There are several places that have Apple IIgs ROMs.  Most work, here's a
list of ROM files which will work with KEGS:

rom01.zip contains APPLE2GS.ROM.  This file is a good ROM01.
rom03.zip contains APPLE2GS.ROM2.  This file is a good ROM03.
xgs.rom is a good ROM01.
iigs_rom01.zip contains APPLE2GS.ROM.  This file is a good ROM01.
iigs_rom03.zip contains APPLE2GS.ROM2.  This file is a good ROM03.
gsrom01.zip contains xgs.rom.  This file is a good ROM01.
gsrom03.zip contains Rom03gd.  This file is a good ROM03.
appleiigs_rom01.zip contains XGS.ROM.  This file is a good ROM01.
apple2_roms.zip contains xgs.rom.  This file is a good ROM01.
	It also contains gsrom03.zip which contains Rom03gd which is a
	good ROM03.
	It also contains gsrom01.zip which contains xgs.rom again, which is
	a good ROM01.


Files that won't work:
APPLE Computer and Peripheral Card Roms Collection.zip: Don't use, the
	file Apple IIgs ROM1 - 342-0077-B -  27C1001.bin is not in the
	format KEGS expects.
