KEGS: Kent's Emulated GS version 1.30
http://kegs.sourceforge.net/

What is this?
-------------

KEGS is an Apple IIgs emulator for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.
The Apple IIgs was first sold in 1986 and was the most powerful computer in
the Apple II line.  An Apple IIgs has the capability to run almost all
Apple II, Apple II+, Apple IIe, and Apple IIc programs.

KEGS supports all Apple IIgs graphics modes (which include all Apple //e
modes), plus plays all Apple IIgs sounds accurately.  It supports
serial port emulation through TCP/IP connections, or can use real
serial ports on Linux and Mac OS X.

The ROMs and GS/OS (the Apple IIgs operating system) are not included
with KEGS since they are not freely distributable.  KEGS is a little
user-hostile now, so if something doesn't work, let me know what went
wrong, and I'll try to help you out.  See my email address at the end of
this file.

KEGS QuickStart:
---------------

Run the KEGSMAC executable (see README.mac.txt on how to get around Mac
security restrictions), or kegswin.exe on Windows 10 or later, or xkegs on
Linux.

You must download and place a ROM file in the directory you run KEGS from,
or in your $HOME directory.  GS ROM version 01 should be named ROM.01, and
GS ROM version 03 should be named ROM.03.  See Getting ROMs below.

Once KEGS is running, if it cannot find a ROM file, it will ask you to
select one using an Apple-II style directory selection screen.  When done,
Press F4 to start.

Press F4 while KEGS is running to select Disk images.  The default config.kegs
will boot Nucleus in s7d1.  If you unmount it (F4->Disk Configuration, go
down to s7d1, press E to eject, then F4, then do Ctrl-F1-F12 to reset and
reboot, then the XMAS demo will start).

Apple IIgs programs need Command and Option keys, and these sometimes are
used by windowing systems on Linux and Windows.  F1 is always Command (or
Open-Apple) and F2 is always Option (or closed-Apple), and F3 is an alias
for ESC.  So entering the IIgs control panel can be done with Ctrl-F1-F3.

Press F5 to toggle the status display.  Press F6 to toggle speed between
1MHz, 2.8MHz, 8MHz, and Unlimited.  You can only see the current speed with
the status lines enabled.

You can resize the KEGS window.


KEGS features:
-------------

Fast 65816 emulation:
	About 500-600MHz on a modern Mac Intel machines.  1GHz on Mac M1.
Emulates low-level 5.25" and 3.5" drive accesses (even nibble-copiers work!).
Emulates classic Apple II sound and 32-voice Ensoniq sound.
	All sound is played in 16-bit stereo at 48KHz.
Emulates all Apple IIgs and Apple II graphics modes, including border effects.
	Can handle display changes at any time (superhires at the top, lores
	at the bottom).  Always does 60 full screen video updates per second.
	Supports 3200-color pictures.
Mouse and joystick support.
Emulated battery RAM remembers control panel settings.
Limited SCC (serial port) emulation to enable PR#1/2 IN#1/2 and Virtual
	Modem enables standard Apple terminal programs to telnet to any
	internet address (or receive connections from another telnet).
Mockingboard A support.  Set slot 4 to "Your card" in the IIgs control panel.
	Note that the mouse doesn't work in GS/OS on ROM01 if slot 4 is
	set to "Your card".
Dynapro: You can mount host directories as volumes for ProDOS 8 and GS/OS,
	allowing easy transfer of data to/from KEGS emulation.  Changes to
	files inside KEGS emulation are immediately made to the files
	visible in the host directory.

KEGS by default emulates a 8MB Apple IIgs, but you can change this from
the Configuration Panel.

KEGS is so accurate, even the built-in ROM selftests pass (you must be in
2.8MHz speed mode to pass the self-tests and you must set the Configuration
Panel entry "Enable Text Page 2 shadow" to "Disabled on ROM 01" for ROM 01.
Otherwise, the selftests will fail with code 040000).

You need to provide:

	1) Patience.
	2) a ROM file called "ROM", "ROM.01" or "ROM.03" in the KEGS directory
		(or in your home directory).  It can be either from a ROM 01
		(131072 bytes long) or from a ROM 03 machine (262144 bytes
		long.)
	3) A disk image to boot.  This can be either "raw" format, 2IMG, or
		Woz.  See discussion below.

Getting ROMs
------------

You need a copy of the memory from fe/0000 - ff/ffff from a ROM 01 GS
or fc/0000 - ff/ffff from a ROM 03 GS, and put that in a file called
"ROM".  I'll eventually write detailed instructions on how to do this.
There are links to download ROM 01 and ROM 03 at
https://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za.


Running KEGS:
------------

The distribution comes with the full source code for all platforms in
the src/ directory, the Linux executable as xkegs, the Windows executable
is kegswin.exe, and the Mac OS X executable as KEGSMAC.app.

See the README.compile.txt file for more info about compiling for Linux.

On Linux, you must start KEGS from a terminal window.  You can double-click
on KEGSMAC.app or kegswin.exe to run those executables.

You need to place the "config.kegs" file someplace where KEGS
can find it.  The simplest place is in your home directory, so copy it there
with the Finder (or using the Terminal).  You can also make the directory
Library/KEGS from your home directory, and then place config.kegs there
along with the ROM file.  You do not need a starting config.kegs file
on a Mac--KEGS will offer to make it for you if it cannot find one.

Start kegs by Double-clicking the KEGSMAC icon on a MAC, or by running
the executable (kegswin on Windows, and kegs on Linux).  KEGSMAC can
be run by the Terminal window on a Mac as well (which enables access to
more debug information) by typing: "./KEGSMAC.app/Contents/MacOS/KEGSMAC".
There may be permissions/security issues on a Mac, see README.mac.txt for
details. 

Assuming all goes well, KEGS will then boot up but probably not find any
disk images.  See below for how to tell KEGS what disk images to use.
Tip: Hitting "F8" locks the mouse in the window (and hides the host cursor)
until you hit "F8" again.


Configuration Panel:
-------------------

You enter the Configuration panel by pressing F4 at any time.  You tell
KEGS what disk images to use through the Configuration panel.  (If KEGS
couldn't find a ROM file, you will be forced into the Configuration
Panel mode until you select a valid ROM file).

To select a ROM file, select "ROM File Selection" and then select your
ROM file.  If you were not forced into the panel at startup, the KEGS
found one and you can skip this step.

Disk Images
-----------

The primary use of the Configuration Panel is to select disk images.  To
change disk images being used, select "Disk Configuration".  Each slot
and drive that can be loaded with an image is listed.  "s5d1" means slot
5, drive 1.  Slot 5 devices are 3.5" 800K disks, and slot 6 devices are
5.25" 140K disks.  Slot 7 devices are virtual hard drives, and can be
any size at all (although ProDOS-formatted images should be less than
32MB).

Just use the arrow keys to navigate to the device entry to change, and
then select it by pressing Return.  A scrollable file selection
interface is presented, letting you locate your image files.  To quickly
jump to a particular path, you can press Tab to toggle between entering
a path manually, and using the file selector. Press Return on ".."
entries to go up a directory level.  When you find the image you want,
just press Return.

If the image has partitions that KEGS supports, another selection
dialog will have you select which partition to mount.  You will probably
only have partitions on direct devices you mount (or on a Mac, of .dmg
images of CDs).  For instance, on a Mac, /dev/disk1 can sometimes be the
CDROM drive.

KEGS can handle "raw", .dsk, .po, 2IMG, 5.25" ".nib" images, most Mac Diskcopy
images and partitioned images, .zip files, .sdk archives, and .woz files.  The
.dsk and .po formats you often find on the web are really "raw" formats, and
so they work fine.  KEGS uses the host file permissions to encode the
read/write status of the image.  KEGS can open any image file compressed with
gzip (with the extension ".gz") or inside a .zip archive automatically as a
read-only disk image.

An image is the representation of an Apple IIgs disk, but in a file on
your computer.  For 3.5" disks, for example, a raw image would be exactly
800K bytes long (819200 bytes).  KEGS directs the emulated GS accesses to
the image, and does the correct reads and writes of the Unix file instead.

To do "useful" things with KEGS, you need to get a bootable disk image.
You can go to: https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_apple2gs
to download GS/OS 6.0.1 (the last official Apple release).

You can also get Apple II programs in ".dsk" format from a variety of
sites on the internet, and these should all work on KEGS as well.

KEGS also supports partitioned devices.  For instance, if you have a CD-ROM
on your computer, just pop an Apple II CD in, and KEGS can mount it, if
you have a Unix-based system (Linux, any Unix, and Mac OS X).

Avoid having KEGS access a writeable image which have mounted on your Mac
at the same time (always unmount it from your Mac before letting KEGS
access it)!

If you do not have any disk mounted in s7d1, KEGS will jump into the monitor.
To boot slot 6 (or slot 5), use the Apple IIgs Control Panel by pressing
Ctrl-Command-ESC (Ctrl-F1-F3 on Windows, for example).

Support for 5.25" Woz nibblized images is limited to using provided images--
KEGS cannot create new images currently.

In addition to changing disks, you can also just "eject" and image by
moving the cursor to select that slot/drive and then press "E".  The
emulated IIgs will immediately detect changes to s5d1 and s5d2.

Care should be taken when changing images in slot 7--KEGS does not notify
GSOS that images have changed (or been ejected), and so it's best to make
changes when GSOS is not running.

"Home": Alias for "=" on the keypad (since my Unix keyboard doesn't have an =).

Alt keys don't work well for Command and Option on Windows.  They only
can be detected when another key is pressed.  So Alt_L-Q will be detected
as Command-Q.  But just pressing Alt_L alone will not do anything.


Using KEGS:
----------

The host computer mouse is the Apple IIgs mouse and joystick by default.
By default, the host pointer is not constrained inside the window and
remains visible.  Press F8 to hide the cursor and constrain the mouse.  F8
again toggles out of constrain mode.

The middle mouse button or Shift-F6 causes KEGS to stop emulation, and enter
the debugger.  You can continue with "g" then return in the debug window.
You can also disassemble memory, etc.  The section "Debugging KEGS"
above describes the debugger interface a little more.

KEGS has no pop-up menus or other interactive interfaces (other than
the debug window, and the occasional error dialogs on Mac OS X).  Input to
the debug window is only acted upon when the emulation is stopped
(Shift-F6, middle mouse button, or hitting a breakpoint).

Quitting KEGS:
-------------

Just close the main KEGS window, and KEGS will exit cleanly.  Or you
can select Quit from the menu.  Or enter ctrl-c in the debugger window.
Or press the middle-mouse button in the emulation window, and then type
"q" return in the debug window.

Command/Option keys:
-------------------

If you have a keyboard with the special Windows keys, you can
use them as the command/option keys.  For those without those keys,
there are several alternatives.

The following keys are Option (closed-apple) (not all keyboards have all
keys):  F2, Meta_R, Alt_R, Cancel, Print_screen, Mode_switch, Option,
or the Windows key just to the right of the spacebar.  The following keys are
Command (open-apple):  F1, Meta_L, Alt_L, Menu, Scroll_lock, Command,
the Windows key left of the spacebar, and the Windows key on the far right
that looks like a pull-down menu.  You can use F1 and F2 if you cannot make
anything else work (especially useful if your OS is intercepting some
Alt or Command key sequences).

If you can't get any of these to work on your machine, let me know.
Note that X Windows often has other things mapped to Meta- and Alt-
key sequences, so they often don't get passed through to KEGS.  So it's
best to use another key instead of Alt or Meta.

The joystick/paddle buttons are just the Command and Option keys.


Reset:
-----

The reset key is Pause/Break or F12.  You must hit it with Ctrl to get it to
take effect (just like a real Apple IIgs).  Ctrl-Command-Reset
forces a reboot.  Ctrl-Command-Option-Reset enters selftests.
Selftests will pass if you force speed to 2.8MHz using the middle
button or F6 (and also set Enable Text Page 2 shadow = Disabled for ROM 01).
Watch out for ctrl-shift-Break--it will likely kill an X Windows session.
Also note that the Unix olvwm X window manager interprets ctrl-F12 and will
not pass it on to KEGS--you'll need to use Break for reset in that case.

Full Screen mode (MAC OS X ONLY):
--------------------------------

KEGS can run in full screen mode--which is especially useful when letting
small kids use KEGS (but it is not really a lock, so do not let a 2 year
old bang on the keyboard while running KEGS).

Full Screen mode is toggled by clicking the green maximize button in the
title bar.  To exit full screen mode, move the mouse to the top of the screen,
and the title bar will reappear, and you can click the green maximize button
to shrink the window down.

All versions of KEGS allow the window to be resized, so you can make the
window take up nearly the full screen without being "full screen" mode.


Joystick Emulation (Mouse, Keypad, or real native joystick):
------------------

The default joystick is the mouse position.  Upper left is 0,0.  Lower right
is 255,255.  Press Shift-F9 to swap the X and Y axes.  Press F9 to reverse
the sense of both paddles (so 0 becomes 255, etc).  Swapping and
reversing are convenient with paddle-based games like "Little Brick Out"
so that the mouse will be moving like the paddle on the screen.  "Little
Brick Out" is on the DOS 3.3 master disk.  The joystick does not work
properly if the pointer is constrained in the window.

You can also select from a "Keypad Joystick" or a real joystick from
the Configuration panel.  Press return on the "Joystick Configuration"
entry, and then select between Mouse Joystick, Keypad Joystick, or one
of two native joysticks.  The Keypad Joystick uses your keypad number
keys as a joystick, where keypad 7 means move to the upper left, and
keypad 3 means move to the lower right.  Pressing multiple keys together
averages the results, allowing finer control than just 8 directions.
Also, joystick scaling is selectable here for games which require
a greater range of motion to work correctly, along with trim adjustment
which moves the centering point.  Adjusting scaling usually means you
will need to adjust the trim as well.

The left mouse button is the mouse button for KEGS.  The right mouse
button (if you have it) or F6 toggles between four speed modes.  Mode 0
(the default) means run as fast as possible.  Mode 1 means run at 1MHz.
Mode 2 means run at 2.8MHz.  Mode 3 means run at 8.0MHz (about the speed
of a ZipGS accelerator).  Most Apple //e (or earlier) games need to be
run at 1MHz.  Many Apple IIgs demos must run at 2.8MHz or they will not
operate correctly.  Try running ornery programs at 2.8MHz.  3200 pictures
generally only display correctly at 2.8MHz or sometimes 8.0MHz.


Debugging KEGS:
--------------

KEGS by default now continues emulation even when it detects buggy programs
running.  (Now I know why Appleworks GS always seemed to crash!).

KEGS divides buggy programs into two severities: Code Yellow and Code Red.
The status is displayed in words in the text area under the emulation window.
If nothing is wrong, nothing is printed.

A Yellow bug is a mild bug where an Apple IIgs program merely read an
invalid location.  Although completely harmless, it indicates the potential
for some Apple IIgs program bug which may become more severe shortly.
For instance, closing the "About This Apple IIgs" window in the Finder
causes a code yellow alert, but it seems quite harmless.

A Code Red bug is a more serious problem.  The Apple IIgs program either
tried to write non-existent memory, entered an invalid system state, or
perhaps just tried to use an Apple IIgs feature which KEGS does not implement
yet.  Note that entering GSBUG tends to cause a Code Red alert always, so if
you intended to enter it, you can ignore it.  My recommendation is to
save work immediately (to new files) and restart KEGS if you get into the
Red mode.

KEGS also supports breakpoints and watchpoints.  In the debug window, you
set a breakpoint at an address by typing 'bp' and then the address.
To set a breakpoint on the interrupt jump point, type:

bp e10010

To list all breakpoints, just type 'bp' with no number after it.
To delete a breakpoint, enter 'bp clear" and then the address:

bp clear e10010

deletes the above breakpoint.  You can also break on a range of addresses:

bp e10400-e107ff

You can erase all breakpoints with:

bp clear all

This is a "transparent" breakpoint--memory is not changed.  But any
read (including instruction fetch) or write to that address will cause KEGS to
halt right after the access occurs.  So you can
set breakpoints on I/O addresses, or ROM, or whatever.  Setting a breakpoint
slows KEGS down somewhat, but only on accesses to the 256 byte "page"
the breakpoint is on. Breakpoints are not just instruction breakpoints,
they also cause KEGS to halt on any data access, too (usually called
watchpoints).

You can get more debugger window help with "help" and "help bp".

Useful locations for setting breakpoints:
bp 3f0		- Break handler
bp c000		- Keyboard latch, programs read keys from this address

For debug, KEGS can log the instruction executed, saving the last 2 million
instructions.  Enable logging with (in the debug window, press F7):

logpc on

Then run whatever you want, and stop KEGS (Shift-F6, middle mouse, or hitting
a breakpoint).  Then in the debug window do:

logpc save

This will create the text file "logpc_out" which you can look at.

You can start KEGS with "logpc on" by passing in the "-logpc" option to
KEGS when you start it.


KEGS command-line option summary:
--------------------------------

There are others, but the Configuration panel provides a better way to
set them so they are no longer listed here.
-skip:	KEGS will "skip" that many screen redraws between refreshes.
	-skip 0 will do 60 frames per second, -skip 1 will do 30 fps,
	-skip 5 will do 10 fps.
-audio [0/1]: Forces audio [off/on].  By default, audio is on unless
	the X display is a remote machine or shared memory is off.
	This switch can override the default.  -audio 0 causes KEGS to
	not fork the background audio process, but Ensoniq emulation
	is still 100% accurate, just the sound is not sent to the
	workstation speaker.  Audio defaults off on Linux for now.
-arate {num}: Forces audio sample rate to {num}.  44100 and 48000 are
	usual, you can try 22050 to reduce KEGS's overhead.  On a reasonably
	fast machine (>250MHz or so), you shouldn't need to mess with this.
-dhr140: Will use the old Double-hires color algorithm that results in
	exactly 140 colors across the screen, as opposed to the blending
	being done by default.
-logpc: Turn on PC logging.  Useful for debugging early startup problems.

X-Windows/Linux options
-15:	KEGS will only look for a 15-bit X-Window display.
-16:	KEGS will only look for a 16-bit X-Window display (not tested, probably
	 will get red colors wrong).
-24:	KEGS will only look for a 24-bit X-Window display.
-display {machine:0.0}: Same as setting the environment variable DISPLAY.
	Sends X display to {machine:0.0}.
-noshm:	KEGS will not try to used shared memory for the X graphics display.
	This will make KEGS much slower on graphics-intensive tasks,
	by as much as a factor of 10!  By default, -noshm causes an
	effective -skip of 3 which is 15 fps.  You can override this
	default by specifying a -skip explicitly.


Apple IIgs Control Panel:
------------------------

You can get to the Apple IIgs control panel (unless some application
has locked it out) using Ctrl-Command-ESC.  On Windows, Command and ESC can
be tricky to enter (Windows grabs them for itself), so Ctrl-F1-F3 is the
same as Ctrl-Command-ESC.

Important things you can do here: Change the speed to 1MHz (for Apple II
compatibility) (or just F6 to change the speed to 1MHz), change the boot
device (so you can boot s6d1 directly), and change Slot 4 to Your Card to
enable Mockingboard.


Moving data into and out of KEGS
--------------------------------

Use the Dynapro image support to mount a folder on your host machine as
a ProDOS volume for ProDOS 8 or GS/OS.  Then use GS/OS (or any other program)
to move files to emulated volumes, or just keep using Dynapro.  See
README.dynapro.txt for more details.

The old utility "to_pro" is now obsolete and removed.

Using the VOC
-------------

KEGS has limited support for the Apple Video Overlay Card (VOC).  The VOC
supports a special 640x400 interlaced SHR video mode which is what KEGS also
supports.  To turn on this mode, you need to do:

Enable VOC (Press F4, select "Video setting"", then select
"Enable VOC = Enabled")

The following write done manually will enable the VOC:

CALL -151
c029:c1		# Turn on SHR
c0b1:39		# Set bits [5:4]=11 to enable Interlaced mode
c0b5:80		# Set bit 7 to enable Interlace mode

And then KEGS will show 640x400 (or 320x400) SHR screen, where even lines
(0,2,4,etc) come from bank $e1 like normal SHR mode, and odd lines come from
bank $e0 (from $2000-$9fff, using it's own palettes, etc.).  The real VOC
shows interlaced data--it draws one frame of data from bank $e1, then the
next from of data from bank $e0, shifted down one line, etc., where each
from takes 16msec, for an effective display of 30fps.  KEGS just draws both
bank $e1 and bank $e1 changes every frame at 60fps.  This can be fixed if
anyone uses this mode and wants better accuracy.


Details on config.kegs and disk images
--------------------------------------

The file "config.kegs" describes the images KEGS will use.  Although you
can edit the file manually, in general you can use the Configuration Panel
to make all the changes you need.  This information is for reference.

KEGS by default will boot s7d1 (unless you've changed that using the
Apple IIgs control panel), so you should put an image in that slot.

KEGS, by default, runs the IWM (3.5" and 5.25" disks) emulation in an
"approximate" mode, called "fast_disk_emul".  In this mode, KEGS
emulates the hardware "faster" than real, meaning the data the code
being emulated expects is made available much faster than on a real
Apple IIgs, providing a nice speed boost.  For instance, the 5.25"
drives run 100x the real speed usually.  Almost everything will work
except for nibble copiers, which don't like the data coming this fast.
Also, formatting new 5.25" disks doesn't work will in fast_disk_emul mode.
(Meaning, unless you're using a nibble copier or formatting a disk, you
shouldn't run into an issue.  Almost all games/demos/etc run fine in this
mode).  To make nibble copiers work, Press Shift-F7.

If you start with a .dsk or other raw image, and do writes to it that are no
longer ProDOS or DOS 3.3 standard, KEGS will automatically treat the image as
"Not-write-through-to-Image" from then on.  This mode means KEGS will continue
to emulate the disk properly in memory, but it cannot encode the changes in
the standard .dsk or .po image format.  It prints a message saying it has done
so.  However, the "disk" in emulation is fully useable as long as KEGS is
running.  A standard reformatting will not cause an image to flip to
not-write- through-to-Image, but running things like a "drive-speed" test will
cause further changes not to propagate to the Unix file.  You will need to
"eject" the image and re-insert it before writes will take effect.

In full accuracy mode (i.e., not fast_disk_emul), 5.25" drive accesses
force KEGS to run at 1MHz, and 3.5" drive accesses force KEGS to run at
2.5MHz.

KEGS supports WOZ version 1 and version 2 images.  These are fully read/write,
but most Woz images are marked read-only in the header.  When accessing a
Woz image, KEGS automatically acts as if fast_disk_emul is disabled.

KEGS Timing:
-----------

KEGS supports running at four speeds:  1MHz, 2.8MHz, 8.0MHz (ZipGS), and
Unlimited.  Pressing the the F6 key cycles between these modes.  The
1MHz and 2.8MHz speeds force KEGS to run at exactly those speeds,
providing accurate reproduction of a real Apple IIgs.

On regular host machines now, sitting at the BASIC prompt can make KEGS
say the speed is 4000MHz or higher.  This is because the emulated code
is reading the keyboard (or other softswitch) more often than 500,000
times per second, and due to how slow accesses work, that's the most
that can be done in one second, and so KEGS has lots of spare time, and
makes the Eff MHz or Sim MHz be too high.  You have to run a BASIC
program or do something not checking for keypresses so often to see what
the true emulation speed is, so something like:

10 A = SIN(A) + 1
20 GOTO 10

is a fine test.

KEGS will always run at 1MHz at least.  If it is unable to keep up,
it will extend the emulated time to maintain the illusion of running
at 1MHz.  That is, it may do just 40 screen refreshes per real second,
instead of the usual 60.  This happens rarely.

(There's a Mac OS X bug in recent releases after 10.13 which can cause KEGS
to draw VERY slowly to the screen, such that KEGS falls below 1MHz.  On your
Mac, go to the Apple Menu->System Settings, then select Displays.  Select
the "Color" tab.  Change to a different setting, usually one with "RGB" in
the name.  See if KEGS now easily exceeds 1MHz).

If you force KEGS to run at 1MHz, it will strive to run at exactly
1MHz (well, really 1.022MHz).  If it is running faster (almost always),
it will pause briefly several times a second to maintain the 1MHz speed.  It
does this in a friendly way that makes time available to other tasks.
This makes older Apple II games very playable just like a
real Apple IIgs on slow speed.  KEGS is running at exactly the same
speed as an Apple //e when in 1MHz mode.  The 1MHz mode you set
through the F6 key overrides the "fast" mode you can access
through the control panel.  But, 3.5" accesses will "speed up" to 2.8MHz
to enable that code to operate correctly while the 3.5" disk is being
accessed.

If you force KEGS to run at 2.8MHz, KEGS tries to run at exactly 2.8MHz.
But like a real unaccelerated Apple IIgs, if you set the control panel
to "slow", it will really be running at 1MHz.  Accesses to 5.25" disk
automatically slow down to 1MHz, when running the IWM in accurate mode
(F7) or when accessing a Woz image.  Many Apple IIgs demos must be run
at 2.8MHz.  The built-in selftests (cmd-option-ctrl-Reset) must run at
2.8MHz.  Many Apple IIgs action games are more playable at 2.8MHz.

The 8.0MHz setting means follow the ZipGS-selected speed, but don't go
faster than 8.0MHz.  This 8.0MHz value can be changed to 8MHz, 16MHz,
32MHz, 64MHz, or 128MHz at the Configuration settings (Press F4), and
change "ZipGS Speed = ".  If your host computer cannot keep up, then the
emulated second will be extended, and KEGS will have choppy audio and
video.  You can use the ZipGS control panel, or ZIPPY.GS on the sample
disk image to set the emulated ZipGS speed to any 1/16th increment of
the selected speed (so if you pick a ZipGS speed of 64MHz on the KEGS
Configuration screen (F4), you can set the emulation speed to any value
from 4-64MHz in 4MHz increments)

The Unlimited setting means run as fast as possible, whatever speed that
is (but always above 1MHz).  Eff MHz gives you the current Apple IIgs
equivalent speed.  Many games will be unplayable at the unlimited
setting.  Setting the IIgs control panel speed to "slow" will slow down
to 1MHz.

Sound output has an important relationship to KEGS timing.  KEGS must
play one second of sound per second of emulated time.  Normally, this
works out exactly right.  But as noted above, if KEGS can't maintain the
needed speed, it extends the emulated second.  If it extends the second
to 1.4 real seconds, that means KEGS only produces 1.0 second of sound
data every 1.4 seconds--the sound breaks up!

In all cases, 1MHz to KEGS is 1.022MHz.  It's just easier to say 1MHz.


KEGS SAMPLE_DISK:
----------------

I'm providing a sample disk of freely available utilities/programs to
demonstrate a little of what KEGS can do.  I'm also including my simple
changes to a benchmark called "SPEEDTEST" to make it run under ProDOS and
time itself automatically.  The SAMPLE_DISK is not bootable since I'm
not sure if I can distribute PRODOS (the OS).


   SPEEDTEST:
   ---------

In the folder "SPEEDTEST", there are two BASIC programs.  OLD.SPEEDTEST
is the old, unmodified DOS 3.3 emulator benchmark by Clayten Hamacher.
It does not run properly under ProDOS 8.  My modified version is
SPEED.PRO, meaning converted to ProDOS.  I made few modifications, other
than to make the benchmarks time themselves.

To run, just say "RUN SPEED.PRO".  To run benchmarks, press "B".  If
you say "A)ll tests", make sure you have a 5.25" disk image in s6d1!
(A blank 140K image will work fine).

This modified SPEED.PRO can run on ANY Apple IIgs emulator (or on the real
thing).

   GSOS7, GSOS5, BYE.SYSTEM:
   ------------------------

These are handy utilities I use on my s7d1 boot disk.  Get a GS/OS 6.x
bootable disk image.  (See GSOS.INFO file for how to get GS/OS).
Remove "PRODOS" from that disk's root directory, and copy GSOS7 to
the root directory.  Then copy SYSTEM/P8 to PRODOS.  Then move
BASIC.System into SYSTEM/.  Then copy BYE.SYSTEM to the root directory,
then move BASIC.SYSTEM back to the root directory.

What all this means is that now the root directory of your system disk
is:  GSOS7, (other stuff), PRODOS, BYE.SYSTEM, and BASIC.SYSTEM.
When you boot, ProDOS will boot (this is PRODOS 8) and will search
for the first *.SYSTEM file, and run it.  BYE.SYSTEM just does a BYE
command, which puts you in the PRODOS 8 textual launcher.
If you now select GSOS7 (the first entry, already highlighted, just
hit return), it will boot GSOS on slot 7.  (Use GSOS5 to boot slot5).
Or, just move down and select BASIC.SYSTEM to go to BASIC.  A very simple
program launcher!?

Note that I didn't write GSOS5 or GSOS7--I just made a one byte hack
to the default GS/OS launcher.  No real wizardry is going on here.


   SHRINKIT3.4, GSHK1.1:
   --------------------

Useful for unpacking .SHK files you can download off of the net.
Always use GSHK (GS/OS version of ShrinkIt) for GS programs since
they may have resource forks.  It's also faster.  GSHK must be run from GS/OS.

   LISTV2.0:
   --------

ProDOS 8 text file lister, useful for viewing text files.

   Wolfenstein3D:
   ------

Wolfenstein 3D for the Apple IIgs.  No kidding!  Must be run from GS/OS.

   SOUND22:
   -------

Cool little ProDOS 8 program (SOUND.EDITOR) that plays hi-fidelity
(relatively) through the old Apple II speaker.  This is included as a
demonstration of how accurate KEGS sound emulation is.

   Sound.Smith.95:
   --------------

GS/OS application that plays SoundSmith songs, which are spreadsheet music,
like MODs.  I included some sample songs--FILE.11, FILE.16, FILE.17, and
SPACE.HARRIER.  Enjoy!

   SOLITAIRE:
   ---------

Klondike.  I like the interface on this game.

   CAT.DOCTOR:
   ----------

From Prosel8 (which is now public domain), this utility is very handy for
sorting directories (among other things).  Useful for arranging GSOS7,
and BYE.SYSTEM mentioned above.

   BGSOUND:
   -------

This CDA lets you play Soundsmith songs in the background while other
applications are running.  Very handy for playing Solitaire with some music.

   DOCVu.CDA:
   ---------

This CDA shows the current DOC contents in real-time.  It has neat visual
effects while playing Soundsmith songs.

   Zippy.gs
   --------

Very useful ProDOS 8 program by Andy McFadden for setting ZipGS parameters.
In KEGS, you'll want to use this to change the Zip speed to less than
100% to make the "Unlimited" speed become limited to 7.5MHz, which is
useful for some games.


KEGS:  What works:
-----------------

Basically, just about every Apple II program works.  See the file
README.a2.compatibility for directions on how to make certain games/programs
work.

KEGS is EXTREMELY compatible.  But, I haven't tested everything.  Let
me know if you find a program which is not working correctly.

Some old Apple II 5.25" games require the old C600 ROM image, and don't work
with the default Apple IIgs ROM.  This is not KEGS's fault--these games
don't run on a real Apple IIgs either.  KEGS has built-in the old Apple II
Disk PROM which you can enable by using the IIgs control panel to set
Slot 6 to "Your Card".  This allows many more Apple II games to run, and
is the recommended setting.

The NinjaForce Megademo mostly works, but sometimes hangs in the BBS Demo.
Just skip that demo if it happens.

The California Demo hangs at startup unless you use the IIgs control panel
to boot from slot 5, and then do a ctrl-Open_Apple-Reset to boot--doing
the above lets it work fine. This seems to be a bug in the demo.


KEGS bugs:
---------

On a ROM03, KEGS makes a patch to the ROM image (inside emulation, not
to the Unix file) to fix a bug in the ROM code.  Both ROM01 and ROM03
are patched to enable use of more than 8MB of memory.  I then patch the ROM
self-tests to make the ROM checksum pass.  But other programs, like
the Apple IIgs Diagnostic Disk, will detect a ROM checksum mismatch.
Don't worry about it.

Sound breaks up if KEGS is unable to keep up, this should not happen on
any modern computer, but resizing the window can cause issues.


Sound emulation:
---------------

KEGS supports very accurate classic Apple II sound (clicking of the
speaker using $C030) and fairly accurate Ensoniq sound.

When KEGS determines that no sound has been produced for more than
5 seconds, it turns off the sound calculation routines for a small
speedup.  It describes that it has done this by saying "Pausing sound"
in the debug window.

If your display is not using shared memory, audio defaults to off unless
you override it with "-audio 1".

Mockingboard emulation is just for the AY8913 sound chip, not for the
SC01 speech chip.  To use the Mockingboard, you must do Ctrl-Cmd-ESC
(Ctrl-F1-F3 on Windows, for example) to get to the IIgs control panel,
select Control Panel, then Slots, then set slot 4 to "Your card".  Make
sure you press return.  Then get out, and then do Ctrl-Cmd-Reset.  The
reset is a limitation of the IIgs ROM, it often doesn't seem to make
proper register changes until the next Reset).


SCC (Serial Port) emulation:
---------------------------

See README.serial.ports.txt.


KEGS status area:
----------------

The status area is updated once each second.  It displays info I am
(or was at some time) interested in seeing.

Line 1: (Emulation speed info)
dcycs:  number of seconds since KEGS was started
sim MHz:  Effective speed of KEGS instruction emulation, not counting
		overhead for video or sound routines.
Eff MHz:  Above, but with overhead accounted for.  Eff MHz is the
		speed of an equivalent true Apple IIgs.  This is extremely
		accurate.
sec:	The number of real seconds that have passed during on of KEGS's
		emulated seconds. Should be 1.00 +/- .01.  Under 1
		means KEGS is running a bit fast, over 1 means KEGS is
		running slow.  When you force speed to 2.5MHz, if KEGS
		can't keep up, it extends sec, so you can see how slow
		it's really going here.
vol:	Apple IIgs main audio volume control, in hex, from 0-F.
pal:	Super-hires palette that is unavailable.  KEGS needs one palette
		for the standard Apple // graphics mode on an 8-bit display,
		and it grabs the least-used palette.  Defaults to 0xe.
		You can try changing it with F10.  If you change it to a
		palette that is not least used, KEGS changes it back in
		one second.  Any superhires lines using the unavailable
		palette will have their colors mapped into the
		closest-matching "lores" colors, to minimize visual
		impact.
Limit:	Prints which speed setting the user has requested: 1MHz, 2.8MHz,
		or Unlimited.

Line 2: (Video and X info)
xfer:  In hex, number of bytes transferred to the X screen per second.
xred_cs:	Percentage of Unix processor cycles that were spent in the X
		server (or other processes on the machine).
ch_in:	Percentage of Unix processor cycles spent checking for X input Events.
ref_l:	Percentage of Unix processor cycles spent scanning the Apple IIgs
		memory for changes to the current display screen memory,
		and copying those changes to internal XImage buffers.
pix/fr:	Number of pixels changed on average for the last 60 frames.


Line 3: (Interpreter overhead)
Ints:  Number of Apple IIgs interrupts over the last second.
I/O:	Rate of I/O through the fake smartport interface (hard drives).
		Does not count 3.5" or 5.25" disk accesses.
BRK:	Number of BRKs over the last second.
COP:	Number of COPs over the last second.
Eng:	Number of calls to the main instruction interpreter loop in the
		last second.  All "interrupts" or other special behavior
		causes the main interpreter loop to exit.  A high call
		rate here indicates a lot of overhead.  12000-15000 is normal.
		20000+ indicates some sort of problem.
act:	Some instructions are handled by the main interpreter loop returning
		special status "actions" to main event loop.  This is the
		number over the last second.  Should be low.
rev:	This tracks EVENTs.  KEGS returns to the main loop to recalc
		effective speed whenever any speed-changing I/O location is
		touched.  See the code, mostly in moremem.c
esi:	This counts the number of superhires scan-line interrupts
		taken in the last second.
edi:	This counts the number of Ensoniq "special events" over the last
		second.  A sound that stops playing always causes a KEGS
		event, even if it doesn't cause a IIgs interrupt.

Line 4: Not used

Line 5: (Host overhead)
sleep_dtime:	Amount of time, in seconds, where KEGS "slept" for the last
		second.  Indicates how idle KEGS was.
out_16ms:	Amount of time, in seconds, KEGS spent drawing to the host
		screen and other overhead, in the last second.
in_16ms:	Amount of time, in seconds, KEGS spent emulating the Apple IIgs
		in the last second.
snd_pl:		Number of times a sound parameter was changed while it
		was playing, but there will always be 60 per second minimum.

Line 6: (IWM info)
For each IWM device, this line displays the current track (and side for
3.5" disks).  If a disk is spinning, there will be an "*" next to the
track number.  Only updated once a second, so the disk arm moving may
appear to jump by several tracks.  "fast_disk_emul:1" shows that KEGS
is using less accurate, but faster, IWM emulation.  Press F7 to toggle
to accurate disk emulation.

X Window (Linux) interface information:
--------------------------------------------

Every version of Linux is different.  Supporting this is very difficult
especially since I do not run Linux myself.

If KEGS fails to start, try the following options:

kegs -audio 0 -noshm

There may be a bug with drawing the border on x86 Linux with Shared Memory--
add the options "-noshm -skip 0" to fix this up (but lose some graphics
performance, sorry).  Try KEGS without these options first, but use
this as a workaround if necessary.

If you want the display to go somewhere different, make sure the shell
environment variable $DISPLAY is set, or give the command-line argument
"-display {foo}".

KEGS also forks off a subprocess to help handle the sound if audio is
active.  If KEGS crashes in a unusual way (a core dump, for instance),
you may have to manually kill the subprocess.  ("ps -ef| grep kegs;kill
xxxxx").

User geoff@gwlink.net adds some notes for mounting disks/floppies/CDs under
Solaris:

  To use a CDROM, insert the CD and let Volume Management mount it.
  Edit kegs_conf and use the filesystem that shows up in the "df -k"
  listing.  The volume name of the CDROM must be included.  For example,
  a CDROM in an IDE drive would look like this:

  /vol/dev/dsk/c1t0d0/ciscocd

  A CDROM in a SCSI drive would look like this:

  /vol/dev/dsk/c0t6d0/j1170_10804

To provide low-level ADB emulation, KEGS turns off Unix key repeat when the
focus is in the KEGS window.  It should be turned back on every time
the pointer leaves the KEGS window, but sometimes it doesn't.  Re-running
KEGS (and then quitting it quickly) should turn key-repeat back on,
or you can type 'xset r' in another terminal window.

Sometimes the converse is true--key repeat is "on" when the cursor is
in the KEGS window.  Moving the cursor out of the window and then
back in should solve it.  This is sometimes noticeable when running
Wolfenstein 3D GS.  I haven't spent much time debugging the problem.
I think it may be the X Server.

KEGS uses a private color-map for its X-window in 8-bit mode.  This
may cause colormap "flash" when your cursor enters the window.

KEGS details/troubleshooting
----------------------------

KEGS will work on all platforms with a 15/16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit
color display.  KEGS also supports an 8-bit display on X windows only.
On all platforms, it autodetects the color depth--no color switching
is necessary as long as you're at a supported depth.


Disk Image Details

Images loaded into slot 6 (drive 1 or 2) are assumed to be 140K
5.25" disks, which is usually have the extension ".dsk".  Images
loaded into slot 5 (drive 1 or 2) are assumed to be 800K disk images
and can be in any supported imahe format (including partitions, if
you have 800K partitions).  Images loaded into slot 7 (drives 1
through 32) can be in any format and can be any size up to 4GB.

KEGS boots s7d1 by default.  You can change this using the emulated IIgs
control panel, just like a real Apple IIgs.  KEGS emulates a IIgs with
two 5.25" drives in slot 6, two 3.5" drives in slot 5, and up to 32
"hard drives" in slot 7.  However, the current Configuration Panel only
lets you set through s7d11.  ProDOS 8 can access disks up to s7d8, but GSOS
has no limit, so it's best to put HFS images past s7d8 in order to leave
more slots for ProDOS images.

If you're trying to use a real host device (CD-ROM, or hard drive, or
floppy), you should make the permissions on the /dev/disk* files something
like (meaning, everyone should have read permission):

brw-r--r--  1 root  operator  14, 0 Jun 10 00:01 /dev/disk2

You can do this on a Mac with:

sudo chmod 644 /dev/disk2

DO NOT RUN KEGS AS ROOT.  It is not designed for this and it's almost certain
problems will ensue.
